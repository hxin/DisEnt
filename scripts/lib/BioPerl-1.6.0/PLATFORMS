Perl general comments:

	o Perl must be 5.6.1 or higher, with perl > 5.8.1 highly recommended.
      perl 5.10 also works.

	o Index.t will fail if you have an out-of-date DBM file
	  installation or a bad DB_File installation

Comments: Only ActiveState Perl >= 5.8 is known to work well, unlike other
          platforms that can use perl 5.6.1.
          Be sure that the module DB_File is installed and up-to-date 
          to allow Bio::Index modules to work properly. 
          Installing ppm's IO-stringy and IO-String and File-Temp are 
	      necessary as well.
