The stable_id database is used by the Registry method get_species_and_object_type().
EnsEMBL REST API heavily relies on this method.

The database can be created on one of the staging servers once all the release databases, which contain
stable_ids to be copied into the stable_id database, are ready.

Currently the following stable ids are copied:

core	  Exon
	  Gene
	  Transcript
	  Translation
	  Operon
	  OperonTranscript

compara	  GeneTree
	  Family

For Gene, Transcript and Translation, an archive_id_lookup is also created, containing all previously used ids



Command to create the stable_id database on ens-staging1 and copy stable ids from databases on ens-staging1 and 2:
