date: 2011-09-22
# minor maintenance release
fixed: xml_pp -i would blank all files after the first one 
       thanks to dvercande for spotting this 
added: findvalues method (XML::Twig and XML::Twig::Elt)
       same as findvalue except that it returns an array of value
added: the output_html_doctype option to XML::Twig::new, that
       outputs the DOCTYPE declaration for HTML docs converted
       by HTML::TreeBuilder (fixing it if necessary)
       see RT #71009: https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=71009
fixed: t/test_autoencoding_conversion.t failed with $PERL_UNICODE

       reported by Martin J Evans, RT #71084
       https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=71084 

version 3.38
date: 2011-02-27
# minor maintenance release
fixed: RT 65865: _ should be allowed at the start on an XML name
       https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=65865
       reported by Steve Prokopowich

version 3.37
date: 2010-10-08
# minor maintenance release
fixed: more tests fixed for HTML::TreeBuilder, hopefully 
       will pass now
removed: making att and class lvalues created problems: in certain
       context they made regular calls to the method create empty 
       attributes. I could find no satisfactory fix,they were either
       incompletes, or to complex for often used methods. So att and
       class are back to being regular, non l-value methods. 
       latt and lclass are the l-value versions.
added: documented the -html option for xml_grep, that allows processing
       HTML input
added: the -Tidy option to xml_grep, that uses HTML::Tidy to convert
       HTML to XML

version 3.36
date: 2010-10-07
# minor maintenance release
added: the use_tidy option to XML::Twig->new, which uses
       HTML::Tidy to convert HTML to well-formed XHTML, as an
       alternative to the default conversion which uses
       HTML::TreeBuilder
added: XML::Twig::Elt method siblings which returns the
       siblings of the element
added: methods att_accessors, elt_accessors and field_accessor
       as well as the similarly named options when creating an 
       XML::Twig
added: set_outer_xml XML::Twig::Elt method
added: print_to_file on an XML::Twig::Elt
added: can use the tag[nested] form in twig handlers that
       triggers on elements 'tag' that include a child 'nested'
added: aliased the add_to_class XML::Twig::Elt method to add_class,
       which seems more natural
added: the remove_class method
added: made att and class lvalues (in perl 5.6 and up)
fixed: copy did not copy the empty status of an element
       RT#31664 spotted by Roland Minner
       https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=31664
fixed: cut_children would always set the empty status of an element,
       even if it had children left
fixed: tests did not pass with HTML::TreeBuilder 3.23_1 due to a
       change in an error message


version: 3.35
date: 2010-05-15
# minor maintenance release
added: the by_file option to xml_grep that limits
       the number of hits per file
added: allowed the text of ignored elements to be buffered
       in a string
fixed: comments need to be escaped (you can't have 2 '-' in a
       row), RT#57389 spotted by Konstantin Tchernov
       https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=57389
fixed: after $elt->cut_children, $elt->empty is false RT#54570
       spotted and patched by Andrew Pimlott
       https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=54570

fixed: documented the fact that latin1 is ISO-8859-15, see RT#37431
       https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=37431


version: 3.34
date: 2010-01-18
# minor maintenance release, test suite fixes
fixed: tests failed when XML::XPath was used as the XPath engine

version: 3.33
date: 2010-01-15
# minor maintenance release, bug fixes
added: XML::Twig::Elt method att_exists which returns true if the attribute
       exists in the XML
added: XML::Twig::Elt method lc_attnames which lower cases the names
      of all the attribute of the element
added: better error message if find_nodes or get_xpath are called instead
      of findnodes when using XML::Twig::XPath (suggested by Zed Pobre)
added: indented_close_tag pretty_print option (suggested by H.Merijn Brand)
added: RT #49692 xml_split test on win 32 systems. Patch sent through RT 
       http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=49692
added: using position selector (eg foo[2]) in handler triggers now raises 
      an error, spotted by Selvakumar
added: you can use css like selectors for class in navigation: 'p.title' will
      select p elements with a class that contains title. 
      In order to preserve backward compatibility and to allow the use of
      elements with a dot in their name, if there are already parsed elements
      with a tag name of 'p.title' then they will be selected instead
added: you can also use css class selectors in trigger handlers. 
fix:  avoids expat (and XML::Parser) "Ran out of memory for input buffer"
      error, and instead reports an "empty file" error (and does not attempt
      to parse the file).
fix:  RT #51432 attributes containing quote character don't escape properly
      found, and patch provided by Jeremy Kahn
      https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=51432

      reported by Osfameron
      http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=48616
fix:  xml_grep bug: warning when --count is used and no match is found
      https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=33269 
      found by Hermann Peifer
fix:  xml_split bug when using an XML declaration and a utf8 encoding. Spotted
      by Chris Price.

      Spotted by Chris Price. 
fix:  failing tests when LWP::UserAgent is not available
fix:  RT #41147: use of uninitialized value in eval when attribute isn't found
      reported by Zed Pobre
      http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=41147
fix:  memory leak when the XML included id's
fix:  XML::Twig::Elt->set_content fails when argument is 'XML::Twig::Elt'
      (or the name of a subclass of XML::Twig::Elt)
      http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=40399
fix:  bug RT #39849, set_output_encoding( 'utf-8') did not work quite right
      on filehandles that were already open in >:utf-8 mode
      spotted by Zed Pobre
      http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=39849

fix:  Makefile.PL doesn't nag the poor tester anymore when running with
      $AUTOMATED_TESTING set
fix:  bug calling set_text when using XML::Twig::XPath, spotted by Ted Sung
fix:  improved speed when parsing big elements, RT#35672, reported by Seth 
      Viebrock (fi is to explicitely return null from the character handler,
      instead of the text already parsed... a few hundred thousand times)
      http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=35672
fix:  RT #47257, minor doc bug, spotted by David Steinbrunner
      http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=47257
fix:  bug in navigation conditions of the form elt[text()=~ /text with 'or' or 'and'/] 
improved: speed, somewhat
      put the project on github: http://github.com/mirod/xmltwig

version: 3.32
date: 
# minor maintenance release with a bug fix
fix:  change to the regexp that parses XPath-like conditions so
      it can accept leading non-ascii letters ([^\W\d] does not 
      work), not used in perl 5.005
fix:  set use utf8 (except in 5.005), which gets rid of the dreaded
      "SWASHNEW" error in 5.6.*, fixed things that then broke in 5.6.
      

version: 3.31
# minor maintenance release, fixing some tests
tests: fixes to stop tests from failing in various configurations
    

Changes in 3.30


      fixed a couple of bugs in namespace handling, spotted by
      Shlomo Yonas (see https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=27617
      and http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=624830)

      added the XML::Twig::Elt fields method which returns a list of
      fields 

      added the normalize method in XML::Twig and XML::Twig::Elt,
      which merge together consecutive pcdata elements. As much as 
      possible (so far after a cut, delete or erase), the twig is 
      kept normalized, eg there are no consecutive #PCDATA elements
      in it. Suggestion of someone whose name (and emails) I can't
      find at the moment.

      added the indented_a / cvs format for pretty_print, that makes the
      output friendly to line-oriented version control tools, as described
      in http://tinyurl.com/2kwscq (RT #24954). Thanks to Sjur Moshagen
      for a patch that I adapted to the current version.

      fixed bug RT #25113: system entities were not properly resolved
      if the XML file was not in the current directory. Thanks to
      Dave Charness for the patch.

      Added the XML::Twig method finish_now that terminates parsing
      immediately, without checking the rest of the XML. This feature was
      half suggested by Nick Clayton

      added the -s option to xml_split, which splits when the given 
      size is reached for a file, suggested by Radek Saturka.

      added the -g option to xml_split, which groups elements to be
      split, suggested and tested by Dhirendra Singh Kholia.

      added the safe_parsefile_html and safe_parseurl_html methods,
      and a --html option to xml_grep. Suggested by Bill Ricker.

      by default xml_grep now skips non well-formed files, the 
      --strict option makes it die when it finds one
      
      fixed a bunch of bugs in xml_grep
     
      fixed a warning when using optional modules with a version
      number that includes an _, spotted and fix suggested by 
      Bill Ricker.

      Fixed test failure on cygwin, thanks to Erik Rantapaa for the
      patch.

      Fixed a bunch of typos in docs, RT #25836, spotted and fixed by David
      Steinbrunner 

      Improved re-use of XML::Twig objects for repetitive parsing. It 
      looks like it should be OK now , but I am sure I haven't tested
      all cases yet (especially when DTDs and entities are involved).

      HTML parsing improved: XML::Twig now tries to find the proper
      encoding for the document (that's not done by HTML::TreeBuilder
      at the moment).

      XML::Twig::Elt purge and flush methods now only purge/flush up to
      the element, not up to the current element in the twig (duh!)

      Fixed bug in handlers of the form elt[string(subelt)="foo"] and
      elt[string(subelt)=1] which did not work at all

      fixed bug in parameter entity output, spotted by BenHopkins on
      perlmonks (see http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=618360)

      fixed bug in xml_string: options were not used
 
      improved error reporting for missing SYSTEM entities, including
      the option to set twig_expand_external_ents to -1, which makes
      missing SYSTEM entities not fatal, but reports them in 
      $t->{twig_missing_system_entities} Thanks to Frank Wegmann for 
      his suggestions and for testing the various versions of the feature

      fixed internals so new versions of Pod::Coverage won't barf
      
Changes in 3.29

      fixed a bug in the handling of handlers after an ignore (RT #24392, 
      reported by Robert Eden).

Changes in 3.28

      now builds on Windows and OS2

      refactored the code that triggers handlers, 
      more complex expressions can now be handled,
      such as '/doc/section[@def="1"]/title'

      COMPATIBILITY WARNING

      Up to version 3.26, you could change the attribute
      of a parent of a node on which you had a handler,
      and be able to trigger a handler on that parent node
      based on the new attribute value:
      XML::Twig->new( twig_handlers =>
        { 'sect/title'          => sub { $_->parent->set_att( has_title => 1)},
          'sect[@has_title="1"]'=> sub { ... }, # called for any sect that has
        }                                       # a title
                    );
      This won't work now. The trigger expression ('sect[@has_title="1"]')
      is evaluated strictly against the input XML. This is more logical and
      consistent (if you changed the element name, the new name was never
      used in the evaluation of the trigger).
      The only exception to that rule is if you use "private attributes": 
      attributes which name starts with a '#'. By definition this in an invalid
      XML name, so it can't be in the input, and has to have been created . In 
      that case the code that evaluates the trigger looks at the attribute in 
      the element in the tree in memory (if it exists). 
      So in the example above, if you replace 'has_title' by '#has_title', 
      everything will work fine. Note that private attributes are not output 
      when using the print/sprint/xml_string... methods.    
     
      fixed xml_pp so it does not leave a tempfile
      and a broken original file all when the original
      file is not well-formed.
      
      added the nparse_pp method that does an nparse
      with pretty_print set to 'indented', nparse_e
      that sets error_context, and nparse_ppe that 
      does both
    
      added XML::Twig::Elt tag_to_span and tag_to_div
      methods (turn an element into a span/div and 
      set its class to the old tag name)

      added the quote option for XML::Twig new, which 
      sets the output quote character for attributes
      ('single' or 'double')

      added the text_only and xml_text_only methods
      that return the text of the element, but not of 
      the sub-elements. 

      added outer_xml method (synonym for sprint)

      fixed bug where entity names were not matched
      properly (RT #22854, spotted by Bob Faist)

      fixed bug  on some DOCTYPE config with 
      twig_print_outside_roots
 
      fixed bug in set_keep_encoding (the method, 
      not the option).

      fixed bug in simplify: the code attempted to
      replace variables in attribute values even if no
      option required it, spotted by Klaus Rush

      clean-up and fixed bugs in ignore: the method
      can now be called from a regular handler (it
      always could but the docs did not say so, 
      thanks to kudra for noticing this). It can
      also be called to ignore a parent of the current 
      element. There were bugs there, and the tree 
      was not built properly

      added error message when an XPath query with
      a leading / is used on a node that does not
      belong to a whole twig (because it's been cut
      or because the twig itself went out of scope)

      when parsing HTML with error_context set, the
      HTML is indented, in order to give better error
      report

Changes in 3.26

      added argument to -i in the Makefile to prevent
      problem in win32

      added XML::Twig::Elt former_next_sibling, 
      former_prev_sibling and former_parent methods

      squashed a memory leak when parsing html
      (forgot to call delete on the HTML::Tree object)

      fixed bug that caused XML::Twig to hang if
      there was a syntax error in a predicate
      (RT#19499, reported by Dan Dascalescu)

      made start_tag and end_tag more consistent: they
      now both return the empty string for comments,
      PIs... (reported by Dan Dascalescu)

      added parsefile_inplace and parsefile_html_inplace
      methods (thanks to GrandFather on perlmonks)

      added support to add css stylesheet in the
      add_stylesheet method (thanks to Georgi Sotirov)

      patched tests to work on Win32

      added set_inner_xml inner_xml and set_inner_html
      methods

Changes in 3.25

      patched to work with perl 5.005!
      fixed a bug in xml_pp when pretty printing a 
      file in place in a different file system

Changes in 3.24

      added loading the text of entities stored in 
      separate files (using SYSTEM) when the (awfully
      named!) expand_external_ents option is used.
      Thanks to jhx for spotting this.

      changed set_cdata, set_pi and set_comment so that
      if you call them on an element of the wrong kind,
      everything works as expected, instead of swallowing
      silently the data. Bug spotted by cmccutcheon

      fixed a whole bunch of things to make the module 
      run and the tests pass on VMS, thanks to Peter 
      (Stig) Edwards who reported bug RT #18655 and 
      provided a patch.

      fixed bug on get_xpath( '/root[1]') expressions,
      RT #18789 spotted by memfrob.

      added the add_stylesheet method, that... adds a 
      stylesheet (xsl type is supported, let me know if
      other types are needed) to a document.

      allowed pasting PI/Comment elements before or after
      the root of a document (see discussion at 
      http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=538550). 
      Thanks to rogue90 for noticing the problem, and to
      Tanktalus for finding the best way to solve it.

      aliased unwrap to erase (eg added the unwrap method
      to XML::Twig::Elt, identical to the existing erase)
      suggested by Chris Burbridge.

      fixed bug RT #17522: flushing twice at the end of 
      the the parse would output the last fragment twice. 
      Spotted by Harco de Hilster.

      dealt with bug RT #17500: parsing a pipe when using
      the UTF8 perlIO layer (through PERL_UNICODE or -C)
      now raises an error, found by Nikolaus Rath.

      made the tests pass when the UTF8 perlIO layer is
      used. At this point potential problems when parsing 
      non-UTF8 XML in this configuration are not trapped.
      

Changes in 3.23

      added autoflush: there is no more need for the
      last $twig->flush after the parsing, it is done
      automatically at the end of the parsing, with the
      same arguments as the first flush on the twig.
      This can be turned of by setting $twig->{twig_autoflush}
      to 0.
      WARNING: if you finished the output with a direct
      print instead of a flush, then this change will 
      cause a bug. Hopefully this should not be the case
      and is easily fixable. 

      fixed bug RT #17145 where get_xpath('//root/elt[1]/child')
      would produce a fatal error if there were no elt 
      element under root. Spotted by Dan Dascalescu.

      fixed bug RT #17064 (comments and PIs after the
      root element were not properly processed), spotted
      by Dan Dascalescu.
      
      fixed bug RT #17044: the SYSTEM value was not
      output in UpdateDTD mode, thanks to Michal
      Lewandowski for pointing this out.

      changed the way empty tags are expanded with the
      'html' style: only tags that are allowed to be 
      empty in XHTML are output as '<tag />', thanks
      to Tom Rathborne for proding me to look into this.

      added a 'wrapped' pretty_print option, that is
      a bit dodgy I think but that might please some.

      fixed bug RT #16540 (tags with specific names 
      (like 'level'), tripped XML::Twig, spotted by
      Graham
    
      added comparison with XML::LibXML in the SEE ALSO
      section (and in the FAQ), following a question
      from surf on c.l.p.m
      
      XML::Twig now rejects string/regexp condition
      in twig_roots
      
      added better error checking in xml_grep
      
      fix for string/regexp condition in xml_grep 

      added support for ! @att (or not @att) in get_xpath
      added support for several predicates in get_xpath
      (not nested predicates though).

      fixed bug RT #15671 (wrong condition interpretation
      for attribute value 0)

      added XML::Twig print_to_file method

      added XML::Twig::Elt methods: following_elt,
      following_elts, preceding_elt, preceding_elts
      (needed to support the corresponding axis in
      get_xpath)

Changes in 3.22

      added the XML::Twig xparse method, which parses
      whatever is thrown at it (filehandle, string, 
      HTML file, HTML URL, URL or file).

      added the XML::Twig nparse method, which creates
      a twig and then calls xparse on the last parameter.

      added the parse_html and parsefile_html methods,
      which parse HTML strings (or fh) and files 
      respectively, whith the help of HTML::TreeBuilder.
      the implementation may still change. Note that
      at the moment there seems to be encoding problems
      with it (if the input is not UTF8).

      added info to t/zz_dump_config.t

      fixed a bug that caused subs_text to leave empty
      #PCDATA elements if the regexp matched at the begining
      or at the end of the text of an element.

      fixed RT #15014: in a few methods objects were 
      created as XML::Twig::Elt, instead of in the classû!F
      of the calling object.

      fixed RT #14959: problem with wrap_children when
      an attribute of one of the child element includes
      a '>'

      improved the docs for wrap_children

      added a better error message when re-using an
      existing twig during the parse

      partially fixed a bug with windows line-endings in
      CDATA sections with keep_encoding set (RT #14815)

      added Test::Pod::Coverage test to please the kwalitee 
      police ;--)

Changes in 3.21

      fixed a test that failed if Tie::IxHash was not
      available

      added link to Atom feed for the CPAN testers 
      results at http://xmltwig.com/rss/twig_testers.rss

Changes in 3.20

      fixed the pod (which caused the tests to fail)   

Changes in 3.19

      redid the fix to RT # 14008, this one should be ok
û!F
      restructured tests

      added the _dump method (probably not finished)

Changes in 3.18

      added a fix to deal with a bug in XML::Parser in the
      original_string method when used in CDATA sections
      longer than 1024 chars (RT # 14008) thanks to Dan 
      Dascalescu for spotting the bug and providing a test 
      case.

      added better error diagnostics when the wrong arguments
      are used in paste

      fixed a bug in subs_text when the text of an element
      included \n (RT #13665) spotted by Dan Dascalescu

      cleaned up the behaviour of erase when the element
      being erased has extra_data (comments or pis) attached

      fixed a bug in subs_text that sometimes messed up text
      after the matching text

      fixed the erase/group_tags option of simplify to make
      it exactly similar to XML::Simple's

      fixed a bug that caused XML::Twig to crash when ignore
      was used with twig_roots (RT #13382) spotted by Larry 
      Siden

      fixed bug in xml_split with default entities (they
      ended up being doubly escaped)

      fixed various bugs when dealing with ids (changing
      existing ids, setting the attribute directly...)

      mark and split now accepts several tags/ as arguments, 
      so you can write for example:
        $elt->mark( qr/^(\w+): (.*)$/, 'dt', 'dd');
      

      added XML::Twig::Elt children_trimmed_text method,
      patch sent by ambrus (RT #12510)

      changed children_text and children_trimmed_text to
      have them return the entire text in scalar context

      fixed bug that caused XML::Twig not to play nice with
      XML::Xerces (due to improper import of UNIVERSAL::isa)
      spotted and patched by Colin Robertson.

      removed most references to 'gi' in the docs, replaced 
      them by tag. I guess Robin Berjon's relentless teasing
      is to be credited with this one.

      added tag_regexp condition on handlers (a regexp instead
      of a regular condition will trigger the handler if the
      tag matches), suggested by Franck Porcher, implementation
      helped by a few Perl Monks 
      (http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=445677).

      fixed typos in xml_split (RT #11911 and #11911),
      reported by Alexey Tourbin

      added tests for xml_split and xml_merge and fixed
      a few bugs in the process

      added the -i option to xml_split and xml_merge,
      that use XInclude instead of PIs (preliminary
      support, the XInclude namespace is not declared
      for example).

			Added the XML::Twig and XML::Twig::Elt trim method
			that trims an element in-place

			Added the XML::Twig last_elt method and the XML::Twig::Elt
			last_descendant method

      Added more tests

Changes in 3.17

      documentation changes, mostly to point better to 
			the resources at http://www.xmltwig.com
			

      fix a few tests that would fail under perl 5.6.*
      and Solaris (t/test_safe_encode.t and t/test_bug_3.15.t),
      see RT bug # 11844, thanks to Sven Neuhaus

      made the licensing terms in the README match the
      ones in the main module (same as Perl), see RT
      bug #11725

      added a test on XML::SAX::Writer version number to 
      avoid failing tests with old versions (<0.39)

      improved xml_split

Changes in 3.16

      added the xml_split/xml_merge tools

      fixed PI handler behaviour when used in twig_roots
      mode

      fix a bug  that prevented the DTD to be output
      when update_DTD mode is on, no DTD is present but
      entities have been created

      added level(<n>) trigger for handlers

      fixed bug that prevented the output_filter to be
      called when printing an element. Spotted thanks to
      Louis Strous.
      
      fixed bug in the nsgmls pretty printer that output
      invalid XML (an extra \n was added in the end tag)
      found by Lee Goddard

      fixed test 284 in test_additional to make it pass 
      in RedHat's version of perl 5.8.0, thanks to
      rdhayes for debugging and fixing that test.

      first shot at getting Pis and comments back in the
      proper place, even in 'keep' mode. At the moment
      using set_pcdata  (or set_cdata) removes all
      embedded comments/pis

      fixed a bug with pi's in keep mode (pi's would not
      be copied if they were within an element) found by
      Pascal Sternis

      added a fix to get rid of spurious warnings, sent
      by Anthony Persaud 

      added the remove_cdata option to the XML::Twig new
      method, that will output CDATA sections as regular
      (escaped) PCDATA

      added the index option to the XML::Twig new method,
      and the associated XML::Twig index method, which 
      generates a list of element matching a condition 
      during parsing

      added the XML::Twig::Elt first_descendant method

      fixed a bug with the keep_encoding option where
      attributes were not parsed when the element name was
      followed by more than one space (spotted by Gerald
      Sedrati-Dinet), 
      see https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=8137

      fixed a bug where whitespace at the begining of an
      element could be dropped (if followed by an element
      before any other character). Now whitespace is
      dropped only if it includes a \n

      added feature: when load_DTD is used, default
      attributes are now filled

      fixed bug on xmlns in path expression trigger 
      (would not replace prefixes in path expressions),
      spotted by amonroy on perlmonks, see
      http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=386764

      optimized XML::Twig text, thanks to Nick Lassonde
      for the patch

      fixed bug that generated an empty line before some
      comments (pointed out by Tanya Huang)

      fixed tests to check XML::Filter::BufferText version
      (1.00 has a bug in the CDATA handling that makes XML::Twig
      tests fail).

      Added new options --nowrap and --exclude (-v) to xml_grep

      fixed warning in tests under 5.8.0 (spotted by Ed Avis)

      skipped HTML::Entities tests in 5.8.0 (make test for this
      module seem to fail on my system, it might be the same 
      elsewhere)

      Fixed bug RT #6067 (problems with non-standard versions of
      Scalar::Utils which do not include weaken)
      Fixed bug RT #6092 (error when using safe output filter)
      Fixed bug when using map_xmlns, tags in default namespace 
      were not output

Changes in 3.15

      Fixes that allow the tests to pass on more systems (thanks to Ed
      Avis for his testing)

      Added normalize_space option for simplify (suggestion of Lambert Lum) 

      Removed usage of $&

      Expanded the doc for paste, as it was a bit short (suggestion of
      Richard Jolly)

Changes in 3.14

      Namespace processing has been enhanced and should work fine now,
      as long as twig_roots is not used.

      COMPATIBILITY WARNING:
      Potentially uncompatible change: the behaviour of simplify has
      been changed to mimic as exactly as possible XML::Simple's XMLin

      Completed the pod to cover the entire API
 
      Tests now pass with perl 5.005_04-RC1 (fail with 5.005 reported
      by David Claughton), added more tests and a config summary at the
      end of the tests

      Added methods on the class attribute, convenient for dealing with
      XHTML or preparing display with CSS:
      class set_class add_to_class att_to_class add_att_to_class 
      move_att_to_class tag_to_class add_tag_to_class set_tag_class in_class
      navigation functions can use '.<class>' expressions

      fixed (yet another!) bug in the way DTDs were output
      fixed bug for pi => 'drop' option

      changed the names of lots on internal (undocumented) methods, prefixed
      them with _

Changes in 3.13

      Maintenance release to get the tests to pass on various platforms

      updated the README
      fixed a problem with encoding conversions (using safe_encode and
      safe_encode_hex) under perl 5.8.0, see RT ticket #5111
      fixed tests to pass when trying to use an unsupported iconv filter    

Changes in 3.12

      New features and greatly increased test coverage

      added lots of tests (>900), thanks to David Rigaudiere, Forrest 
      Cahoon, Sebastien Aperghis-Tramoni, Henrik Tougaard and Sam Tregar
      for testing this release on various OSs, Perl, XML::Parser and 
      expat versions.

      added XML::Twig::XPath that uses XML::XPath as the XPath engine
      for findnodes, findnodes_as_string, findvalue, exists, find and
      matches. Just use XML::Twig::XPath instead of use XML::Twig;
      (see the tests in t/xmlxpath_*).

      Added special case to output some HTML tags ('script' to start with)
      as not empty.
      XML::Twig::Elt->new now properly flags empty elements (spotted by
      Dave Roe)
      added XML::Twig::Elt contains_a_single method
      added #ENT twig_handlers (not necessarily complete, so not yet
      documented, needs more tests)
      added doc for XML::Twig and XML::Twig::Elt subs_text methods
      tags starting with # are now "invisible" (they are not output),
      useful for example for pretty_printing
      added new options --wrap '' and --date to xml_grep
      improved XPath support (added [nb] support)
      added xpath method, which generates a unique XPath for an element
      added has_child and has_children as synonyms of first_child
      added XML::Twig::set_id_seed to control how generated id's are
      created

      when using ignore on an element, end_tag_handlers are now tested
      at the end of the element (so you can for exemple get the byte 
      offset in the document), suggestion of Philippe Verdret

      added XML::Twig::Elt change_att_name 
      XML::Twig::Elt new now properly works when called as an object
      (and not a class) method

      fixed namespace processing somewhat
      fixed SAX output methods
      fixed bug when keep_atts_order on and using set_att on an element
      with no existing attribute (spotted by scharloi) 

      COMPATIBILITY WARNING:
      WARNING - potentially incompatible changes -
      when using finish_print, the document used to be flushed. This is no
      longer the case, you will have to do it before calling finish_print. 
      This way you have the choice of doing it or not.

      Removed XML::Twig::Elt::unescape function (was no longer used)

Changes in 3.11

      added --text_only option to xml_grep (outputs the text of the
      result, without tags)

      fixed bug where "Comments [was] always dropped after a twig 
      object set 'comments' to 'drop'" (RT#3711), bug report and first
      patch by Simon Flack

      by popular demand, added option "keep_atts_order" that keeps the
      original attribute order in the output. This option needs the
      Tie::IxHash module to work.

Changes in 3.10

      added xml_pp xml_grep and xml_spellcheck to the distribution

      the print method now calls 'print $elt->sprint' instead of printing
      content as it converts them to text, in order to reduce the number
      of calls to Perl's print (which should increase performance)

      changed XML::Twig::Elt erase to allow erasing the root element 
      if it has only 1 child

      added findvalue method to XML::Twig and XML::Twig::Elt

      aliased findnodes to get_xpath in XML::Twig and XML::Twig::Elt

      added the elt_class option to XML::Twig::new

      added the do_not_chain_handlers option to XML::Twig::new

      added the XML::Twig::Elt is_first_child and is_last_child methods

      set_gi,set_text, prefix, suffix, set_att, set_atts, del_atts, del_att
      now return the element for easier chains

      Fixed a bug in pretty printing comments before elements (RT #2315)

      Added the XML::Twig::Elt children_copy method which returns a list
      of elements that are copies of the children of the element

      Fixed a bug in wrap_in when the element wrapped is not attached to a tree

      Fixed a bug with get_xpath: regexp modifiers were not taken into account
      spotted by Eric Safern (RT #2284)

      Fixed a bug in methods inherited from XML::Parser::Expat (arguments
      were not properly passed)

      Installed local empty SIG handlers to trap error messages triggered
      by require for optional modules, so that user signal handlers would
      not have to deal with them (suggestion from Philippe Verdret)

      Fixed a bug in the navigation XPath engine: text() was used instead of 
      string(). Both are now allowed.

      Added XML::Twig::Elt sort_children, sort_children_on_value, 
      sort_children_on_att and sort_children_on_field methods that sort the
      children of an element in place

      Added XML::Twig::Elt field_to_att and att_to_field methods

      Fixed a memory leak due to ids not being weak references

      Added the XML::Twig::Elt wrap_children method that wraps children
      of an element that satisfy a regexp in a new element

      Added the XML::Twig::Elt add_id method that adds an id to an element
      
      Added the XML::Twig::Elt strip_add method that deletes an attribute
      from an element and its descendants

      COMPATIBILITY WARNING
      Fixed a quasi-bug in set_att where the hash passed in reference was
      used directly, which makes it a problem when the same reference is
      passed several times: all the elements share the same attributes.
      This is a potentially incompatible change for code that relied on 
      this feature. Please report problems to the author.

      fixed a bug in set_id

      fixed a bug spotted by Bill Gunter: allowed _ as the initial character 
      for XML names. Also now allow ':' as the first element

      added the simplify methods, which load a twig into an XML::Simple like 
      data structure

      fixed a bug in get_type and is_elt, spotted and fixed by Paul Stodghill

      added the XML::Twig::Elt ancestors_or_self method

      fixed bug when doc root is also a twig_root (twig was not built)

      updated the README (fleshed out examples, added OS X to the list of 
      tested platforms)

      fixed a bug when using the no_dtd_output option

      added doc for the XML::Twig::Elt children_count method

      added the XML::Twig::Elt children_text method

      updated the doc so it can be properly formated by my custom pod2html,
      the generated doc (with a bigger ToC and better links) is available
      from the XML::Twig page at http://xmltwig.com/xmltwig/
      
Changes in 3.09

      added XML::Twig::Elt xml_text method

      fixed several bugs in the split method under 5.8.0 when matching a utf8
      character (thanks to Dominic Mitchell who spotted them)

      cleaned-up the pod (still in progress)

      added the XML::Twig::Elt pos method that gives the position of
      an element in its parent's child list

      re-introduced parseurl (thanks to Denis Kolokol for spotting its 
      absence in this version)

      Fixed a bug: ent_tag_handlers were not called on the root (thanks
      to Philippe Verdret

      Improved #PI (also declared as '?') and #COMMENT handler support 

      added check on reference type (must be XML::Twig::Elt) in 
      XML::Twig::Elt::paste (patch by Forrest Cahoon)

Changes in 3.08

      The previous fix wasn't enough :--( 

Changes in 3.07

      Fixed the way weaken is imported from Scalar::Util

Changes in 3.06

      Added XML::Twig::Elt trimmed_text and related methods (trimmed_field,
      first_child_trimmed_text, last_child_trimmed_text...)

      Added XML::Twig::Elt replace_with method

      Added XML::Twig::Elt cut_children method

      Added XML::Twig contains_only method

      Added *[att=~ /regexp/] condition type (suggested by Nikola Janceski)

      Fixed a bug in the way handlers for gi, path and subpath were chained
      (Thanks to Tommy Wareing)

      Fixed a bug where entities caused an error on other handlers (Thanks
      to Tommy Wareing)

      Fixed a bug with string(sub_elt)=~ /regexp/ (thanks to Tommy Wareing)

      Fixed a bug with output_filter used with expand_external_entities
      (thanks to Tommy Wareing)

      Fixed (yet another!) bug with whitespace handling (whitespace, then an
      entity made the whitespace move after the entity) (spotted by the usual
      Tommy Wareing)

      Added an error message when pasting on an undef reference (suggestion
      of Tommy Wareing)

      Fixed a bug in in_context (found by Tommy Wareing)

      Fixed a bug when loading the DTD (local undef $/ did not stay local,
      bug found and patch sent by Steve Pomeroy and Henry Cipolla)

      Fixed a bug in setting output filter

      Fixed a bug in using a filehandle with twig_print_outside_roots

      Added safe_encode_hex filter

      fixed bug in set_indent, $INDENT not set properly (thanks
      to Eric Jain)

      fixed dependencies (no check with 5.8.0, added Scalar::Util
      as a possible source for weaken)

      Added no_prolog option to XML:Twig::new

      Tested build on Windows (thanks to Cory Trese and Josh Hawkins)


    Changed in 3.05

      Added _ALPHA_ SAX export methods: 
        XML::Twig toSAX1, toSAX2, flush_toSAX1, flush_toSAX2
	XML::Twig::Elt toSAX1, toSAX2

      The following gotchas apply:

        - these methods work only for documents that are completely
          loaded by XML::Twig (ie if you use twig_roots the data
          outside of the roots will not be output as SAX). 
        - SAX1 support is a bit dodgy: the encoding is not preserved
	  (it is always set to 'UTF-8'),
	- locator is not supported (and probably will not, what's the 
	  location of a newly created element?)

      Also when exporting SAX you should consider setting Twig to a 
      mode where all aspects of the XML are treated as nodes by XML::Twig,
      by setting the following options when you create the twig:
      comments => 'process', pi => 'process', keep_spaces => 1
       
     
      twig_print_outside_roots now supports a file handle ref as argument:
      the untouched part of the tree will be output to the filehandle:

      Added the 'indented_c' style that gives a slightly more compact pretty
      print than 'indented': the end tags are on the same line as the 
      preceeding text (suggestion of Hugh Myers)
     
      Added option in get_xpath (aka find_nodes) to apply the query to
      a list of elements 

      Added processing of conditions on the current node in get_xpath:
      my @result= get_xpath( q{.[@att="val"]});
      This is of course mostly useful with the previous option.
      The idea stemmed from a post from Liam Quin to the perl-xml list

      Added XML::Twig xml_version, set_xml_version, standalone, set_standalone
      methods on the XML declaration

      Fixed a bug in change_gi (which simply did not work at all), found
      by Ron Hayden.

      Fixed bug in space handling with CDATA (spaces before the CDATA section
      were moved to within the section), comments and PI's

      Fixed bug in parse_url (exit was not called at the end of the child),
      found by David Kulp

      Cleanup a bit the code that parses xpath expressions (still some work 
      to be done on this though), fixed a bug with last, found by Roel de Cock

      Fixed the SYNOPSIS (parsefile is used to parse files, spotted by 
      e.sammer)

      Fixed a bug in pretty printing (reported by Zhu Zhou)

      Fixed a bugin the install: the Makefile now uses the same perl used 
      to perl Makefile.PL to run speedup and check_optional_modules 
      (reported by Ralf Santos)

      Fixed bugs in pretty printing when using flush, trying to figure out
      as well as possible if an element contains other elements or text 
      (there is still a gotcha, see the BUGS section in the docs) 

      Fixed a bug that caused the XML declaration and the DTD not to be reset
      between parses

      Improved the conversion functions (errors are now reported when the
      function is created and not when it is first used)

      Added the output_encoding option to XML::Twig->new, which allows 
      specifying an encoding for the output: the conversion filter is
      created using Encode (perl 5.8.0) Text::Iconv or Unicode::* The
      XML declaration is also updated

      #CDATA and #ENT can now be used in handler expressions

      added XML::Twig::Elt remove_cdata method, which turns CDATA sections
      into regular PCDATA elements

      set_asis can now be used to output CDATA sections un-escaped (and without
      the CDATA section markers) 

    Changed in 3.04

      Fixed handlers for XML::Parser 2.27 so the module can pass the tests

    Changed in 3.03

      fixed bugs in entity handling in twig_roots mode

      added the ignore_elts option, to skip completely elements

      enhanced the XPath-like syntax in navigation and get_xpath
      methods: added operators (>, < ...)

      fixed [RT 168]: setTwigHandler failed when no handler was already set
      (thanks to Jerry)
      
      turned %valid_option into a package global so AnyData can access it
      
      fixed a bug in sprint that prevented it from working with filters

      fixed a bug in erase when erasing an empty element that was the
      last child of its parent ([RT390], thanks to Julian Arnold)
      
      copy now correctly copies the asis status of elements

      fixed typos on the docs (thanks to Shlomo Yona)

      added tests (for erase and entities in twig_roots mode)

    Changed in 3.02

      Tweaked speedup to replace constructs that did not work in
      perl 5.005003

    Changed in 3.01
    
      Fixed the directory name in the tar file 

    Changed in 3.00

      COMPATIBILITY WARNING
      WARNING: THIS CHANGE IS NOT BACKWARD COMPATIBLE

      But it is The Right Thing To Do

      In normal mode (when KeepEncoding is not used) the XML data is
      now stored as parsed by XML::Parser, ie the base entities are
      expanded. The "print" methods (print, sprint and flush, plus the
      new xml_string, pcdata_xml_string and att_xml_string) return the
      data in XML-escaped form: & and < are escaped in PCDATA and
      &, < and the quote (" by default) are turned to &amp; &lt; and
      &quot; (or &apos; if the quote is '). The "text" methods (text,
      att and pcdata) return the stored text as is.
      So if you want to output XML you should use the "print" methods
      and if you want to output text you should use the "text" methods.

      Note that this breaks the trick consisting in adding tags to the
      content of an element: $elt->prefix( "<b>") no longer adds a <b>
      tag before an element. $elt->print will now output "&lt;b>...".
      (but you can still use it by marking those elements as 'asis').
      It also fixes the annoying &apos; thingie that used to replace '
      in the data. 

      When the KeepEncoding option is used this is not true, the data
      is stored asis, base entities are kept un-escaped.

      Note that KeepEncoding is a global setting, if you use several twigs,
      some with KeepEncoding and some without then you will have to manually
      set the option using the set_keep_encoding method, otherwise the last
      XML::Twig::new call will have set it

      In addition when the KeepEncoding option is used the start tag is
      parsed using a custom function parse_start_tag, which works only
      for 1-byte encodings (it is regexp-based). This method can be 
      overridden using the ParseStartTag (or parse_start_tag) option
      when creating the twig. This function takes the original string as
      input and returns the gi and the attributes (in a hash).
      If you write a function that works for multi-byte encodings I would
      very much appreciate if you could send it back to me so I can add it
      to the module, so other users can benefit from it.

     An additional option ExpansExternalEnts will expand external entity
     references to their text (in the output, the text stored is &ent;).

    Added

      When handlers (twig_handlers or start_tag_handlers) are called
      $_ is set to the element node, so quick hacks look better:
      
      my $t= new XML::Twig( twig_handlers => 
               { elt => sub { print $_->att( 'id'), ": ", $_->text, "\n"; } }
	                  );

      XML::Twig dispose method which properly reclaims all the memory
        used by the object (useful if you don't have WeakRef installed)

      XML::Twig and XML::Twig::Elt ignore methods, which can be called
        from a start_tag_handlers handler and cause the element (or the
        current element if called on a twig) to be ignored by the 
        parsing

      XML::Twig parse_start_tag option that overrides the default function
        used to parse start tags when KeepEncoding is used

      XML::Twig::Elt xml_string, pcdata_xml_string and att_xml_string
        all return an XML-escaped string for an element (including 
	sub-elements and their tags but not the enclosing tags for the 
	element), a #PCDATA element and an attribute

      XML::Twig::Elt methods tag and set_tag, equivalent respectively
        to gi and set_gi
      
      XML::Twig and XML::Twig::Elt set_keep_encoding methods can be used
        to set the keep_encoding value if you use several twigs with 
        different keep_encoding options

      Option names for XML::Twig::new are now checked (a warning is output
        if the option is not a valid one);

      when using pretty_print nice or indented keep_spaces_in is now checked
        so the elements within an element listed in keep_spaces_in are not
        indented

      XML::Twig::Elt insert_new_elt method that does a new and a paste

      XML::Twig::Elt split_at method splits a #PCDATA element in 2

      XML::Twig::Elt split method splits all the text descendants of an 
        element, on a regep, wrapping text captured in brackets in the
        regexp in a specified element, all elements are returned 

      XML::Twig::Elt mark method is similar to the split method, except
        that only newly created elements (matched by the regexp) are
        returned

      XML::Twig::Elt get_type method returns #ELT for elements and the gi
        (#PCDATA, #CDATA...) otherwise

      XML::Twig::Elt is_elt returns the gi if the element is a real element
         and 0 if it is #PCDATA, #CDATA...
      
      XML::Twig::Elt contains_only_text returns 1 if the element contains no
         "real" element (is_field is another name for it)

      First implementation of the output_filter option which filters the
      text before it is output by the print, sprint, flush and text methods
      (only works for print at the moment, and still under test with various
      versions of XML::Parser). Standard filters are also available

      Example:
        
        #!/bin/perl -w
        use strict;
        use XML::Twig;

        my $t = new XML::Twig(output_filter => 'latin1');
        $t->parse( \*DATA);
        $t->print;
 
        __DATA__
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
        <docé té="valué">Un homme soupçonné d'être impliqué dans la mort 
             d'un motard de la police, renversé</docé>

      The 'latin1', 'html' and 'safe' filters are predefined, you can also
      build additional filters using Iconv (requires text::Iconv) and 
      Unicode::String (requires Unicode::String and Unicode::Map8):

      my $conv = XML::Twig::iconv_convert( 'latin1');
      my $t = new XML::Twig(output_filter => $conv);

      my $conv = XML::Twig::unicode_convert( 'latin1');
      my $t = new XML::Twig(output_filter => $conv);

      warning: conversions work fine with XML::Parser 2.27 but sometimes fail
      with XML::Parser 2.30 (on Perl 5.6.1, Linux 2.4 on a PC) when using 
      'latin1' without Text::Iconv or Unicode::String and Unicode::Map8
      installed.

      The input_filter option works the same way, except the text is 
      converted before it is stored in the twig (so you can use regexp in 
      your native encoding for example) 

      the XML::Twig::Elt set_asis method sets a property of an element that
      causes it to be output asis (without XML-escaping < " and &) so you
      can still create tagged text

      the XML::Twig::Elt prefix and suffix methods accept an optional
      'asis' argument that causes the prefix or suffix to get the asis
      property (so you can do $elt->prefix( '<b>foo</b>', 'asis') for
      example)

      the XML::Twig and XML::Twig::Elt find_nodes methods are aliases
      to the get_xpath method (this is the name used in XML::XPath)

      the XML::Twig parseurl and safe_parseurl methods parse a document
      whose url is given

      XML::Twig::Elt extra_data, set_extra_data and append_extra_data to
      access the... extra data (PI's and comments) attached to an element

      XML::Twig method parser returns the XML::Parser::Expat object used
      by the twig 

      Most XML::Parser::Expat methods are now inherited by XML::Twig
      objects

      XML::Twig::Elt descendant_or_self method that returns the element
      and its descendants

    Fixed
      element (and attribute) names can now include '.'
      get_xpath now works for root based XPath expressions ('/doc/elt') 
      get_xpath now works for regexps (including regexps on attribute values)
      you can now properly restore pretty_print and empty_tag_style values
      speedup (at install) now checks the Perl version and uses qr or ""
        so XML::Twig works in 5.004 
      XML::Twig::Elt wrap_in now allows wrapping the root element

      various bugs in the DOCTYPE and DTD output with XML::Parser 2.30
      
      the tests to fix a bug when working with XML::Parser 2.27  
      the tests to fix a bug preventing test2 to pass under windows

      _default_  handlers now work (thanks Zoogie)

      the text method now returns the XML base entities (<>&'") un-escaped
      (thanks to Hakan Kallberg's persistence to ask for it ;--)

      pretty_print works better for elements without content

      end_tag_handlers now work properly (thanks to Phil Glanville for the
      patch).

    Enhanced

      Attributes which name starts with # are not output by the print
      methods, and thus can be used to store private data on elements

      WeakRef is used if installed, so no more memory leaks
 
      Sped-up print and flush by creating the _print and _flush methods 
      which do not check for file handle and pretty print options

      The doc has been enhanced and somewhat restructured. All options are
      now written as this_is_an_option although the legacy form thisIsAnOption
      can still be used. Links now display properly in the text form (thanks to
      Dominic Mitchell for spotting this and sending a patch)

      Navigation functions (including descendants) now allow not only a gi
      to be used as filter, but also the '#ELT' token, to filter only "real"
      elements (as opposed to #PCDATA, #CDATA, #PI, #COMMENT, #ENT), the 
      '#TEXT' token, to filter only text (PCDATA and CDATA elements), 
      regular expressions (built with qr//) applied on the elements gi's,
      code references, the code is passed the element as argument, and a
      subset of XPath.
      Functions that can use this token are: children, first_child, last_child,
      prev_sibling, last_sibling, next_elt, last_elt, descendants, get_xpath,
      child, sibling, sibling_text, prev_siblings, next_siblings field, 
      first_child_text

      The paste method now accepts a 'within' position, which inserts the
      element at the $offset argument (a 3rd, required, argument) in the
      reference element or in its first text child 

      The XML::Twig::Elt insert method now accepts attributes (hashrefs)
      applied to the element(s) being inserted:
      $elt->insert( e1 => { a => 'v'}, e2 => e3 => { a1 =>'v1', a2 => 'v2'}); 

      The XML::Twig::erase method now outputs a meaningful error message if
      applied to the root (or a cut element)

      Optimizations for better performances (in the end performances are about
      the same or a little worse than XML::Twig 2.02 but the module is much
      more powerful)

    Known bugs:

    The DTD interface is completely broken, and I have little hope of
    fixing it considering I have to deal with 2 incompatible versions of
    XML::Parser. Plus no one seems to be using it...

    Some XPath/Navigation expressions using " or ' in the text()="" part
    of the expression will cause a fatal error

    Note that this version works better (but doesn't necessarily require)
    with WeakRef (Perl version 5.6.0 and above) and Text::Iconv for all
    its encoding conversions.
