4126706	16689796	Data demonstrate that MrpC binds to at least eight sites in the upstream region of its promoter, and suggest a mechanism by which MrpC and FruA are regulated during the M. xanthus life cycle [MrpC]
4126706	17573816	FrzS contains a novel 'pseudo-receiver domain' whose function requires recognition of the RD output face but not Asp phosphorylation.
4126706	17581122	These experiments showed that FrzZ plays a direct role as an output of the Frz chemosensory pathway and that both CheY domains of FrzZ are functional. [FrzZ]
4126706	17590236	FrzS has distinct domains required for residence at the leading cell pole, pole-to-pole transport and lagging cell pole.
4126706	18310035	These results, together with the finding that CarF is located at the membrane, support the hypothesis that CarF acts as an anti-antisigma factor.[CarF in strain DK1050]
4126706	18315685	findings reveal that light-induced carotenogenesis in M. xanthus is regulated by at least two parallel pathways orchestrated by a pair of paralogous genes, CarA and CarH, of which one, but not the other, is dependent on vitamin B12 [CarA, CarH]
4126706	18390653	Results show that EspA plays a key role in the timing of expression of genes necessary for progression of cells through the developmental program: [EspA]
4126706	18554333	The three tetra trico-peptide repeats of FrzF negatively regulate FrzCD methylation. [FrzCD, FrzF]
4126706	18846531	We identified 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) synthase (MvaS) to be involved in biosynthesis pathway to isovaleryl-CoA in Myxococcus xanthus. [MvaS]
