=head2 member_start

  Arg [1]     : (optional) $member_start
  Example     : $object->member_start($member_start);
  Example     : $member_start = $object->member_start();
  Description : Getter/setter for the member_start attribute. For non-global
                alignments, this represent the starting point of the local
                alignment.
                Currently the data provided as MemberDomains (leaves of the
                GeneTree) are obtained using global alignments and the
                member_start is always undefined.

  Arg [1]     : (optional) $member_end
  Example     : $object->member_end($member_end);
  Example     : $member_end = $object->member_end();
  Description : Getter/setter for the member_end attribute. For non-global
                alignments, this represent the ending point of the local
                alignment.
