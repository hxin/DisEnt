This file describes how to create an image with our species tree.

First, we need to re-scale the tree in order to improve the readability.
We use a log-scale and make internal branches slightly smaller than final
ones:

more ../../scripts/pipeline/species_tree_blength.nh | \
  perl -e '$_ =~ s/\)\w+/\)/g;
    $_ =~ s/\?\w+/XXXXXXXXXXX/g;
    my @a = split(/([\)\,])/, $_);
    foreach my $a (@a) {
      if ($a =~ /(.*\w\:)(\d\.\d+)(.*)/) {
        print $1, log(1.6+$2), $3; # final branches, make them slightly larger than...
      } elsif ($a =~ /(.*)(\d\.\d+)(.*)/) {
        print $1, log(1.2+$2), $3; # ... internal branches
      } else {
        print $a;
      }
    }' -n > species_tree.nw

Open Dendroscope. Load the file and select the Radial Phylogram (Ctrl+7).
- Select everything (Ctrl+A) and change the font size to 14 ("Edit" > "Format")
- In the view menu, deselect "Sparse labels" and choose "Radial labels".
- Adjust the tree, by rotating it left or right.
- Remove species not in e! by selecting them and Ctrl+Backspace (their names show as XXXXX.n)
- Rotate nodes with Ctrl+Shift+T if you wish (Cionas tend to get on the internal side after removing mosquitoes)

If you want to let Dendroscope load the figures automatically, do:
cd ~/src/public-plugins/ensembl/htdocs/i/species/48/
cvs up -dP
mkdir ~/tmp/species_tree_imgs
ls *.png | while read i; do \
  cp $i ~/tmp/species_tree_imgs/$i; done
And go to Options -> Load Taxon Images...
You can change the size of the images in Options -> Set Image Size...

Save the file as an SVG and edit it to replace the images / labels as they usually overlap one another.

Tips:
1. Use inkscape (from the GNOME project) for relocation the taxa images. Use Ctrl+Shift+G to ungroup all in order to move the images freely.
2. Add "Image obtained using Dendroscope (D.H. Huson and C Scornavacca, Dendroscope 3: An interactive tool for rooted phylogenetic trees and networks, Systematic Biology, 2012)" at the bottom of the image
3. Shrink the drawing area to about 1200x900
4. Export the image into a PDF ("File" > "Save a Copy") and into a PNG ("File" > "Export Bitmap")

Commit the SVG, PDF and PNG in this directory.

To get the PDF accessible from the webpage, you must also commit the PDF file into
public-plugins/ensembl/htdocs/info/about/ (Check that the file is there and email the webteam otherwise).
